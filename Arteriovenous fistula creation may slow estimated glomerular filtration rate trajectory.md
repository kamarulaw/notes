### Abstract

#### Background
- The authors practice the timely placement of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in patients facing chronic hemodialysis.  The authors have anecdotally observed after AVF creation that there appears to be a slowing of the decline in kidney function as measured by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
- The present retrospective observational analysis was performed to assess the possibility that a successfully created AVF could be associated with the slowing of the eGFR trajectory

#### Methods
- Authors identified 123 patients between 2005 and 2010 with at least two eGFR determinations for 2 years before and up to 2 years after AVF creation.  Inclusion eligibility was that the fistula was maturing by the nephrologists initial post creation examination
- Termination events were death, starting dialysis, or transplantation.  Each subject served as their own control for the pre- and post- AVF-creation eGFR measurements

#### Results
- Subjects median age was 68 yrs old and 56% were diabetic.  The rate of change of the eGFR for the 2 years prior to AVF creation was -5.9 mL/min/year and after AVF creation -.5 mL/min/year

#### Conclusion
- A functioning AVF may be associated with a slowing of the eGFR decline
- Agreeing to timely AVF creation selects patients in an otherwise typical population and other confounders have not yet been eliminated
- To do so a thorough prospective observational study is indicated
