## OpthoBook 

##### **Timothy Root, M.D**

Summary: Free book by Timothy Cook that is meant to serve as a broad introduction to the field of ophthalmology.

### Chapter 3: Introduction to Glaucoma
- Glaucoma is a disease where the optic nerve dies, but high intraocular pressure certainly seems to be associated, if not entirely the cause, of optic nerve death.  It is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in the U.S
- Patients with acute glaucoma can develop irreversible vision loss within a few hours
- Aqueous is the fluid that fills the front part of the eye.  It is important for maintaining the shape of the eye
- The pressure within the eye is maintained by the steady state of aqueous production, and an imbalance in this equilibrium causes the increased pressure associated with glaucoma 
- There are two types of glaucoma that have very different mechanisms.  Open-angle and Closed-angle glaucoma
- OA: Occurs from decreased aqueous drainage caused by an unidentified dysfunction or microscopic clogging of the trabecular meshwork.  Leads to chronically elevated eye pressure, which leads to gradual vision loss
- Most patients are over the age of 40.  And the condition is more common in African Americans
- The major risk factors are family history, age, race, high eye pressure, and large vertical nerve cupping.  More recently, thin corneas have been found to be a huge risk factor 
- Detecting OAG requires early pressure screening.  Free screening clinics also use different types of automated visual-field testing to detect subtle peripheral vision loss
- OAG patients usually present with three exam findings: elevated eye pressures, optic disk changes, and repeatable visual field loss patterns
- *Pressure*: Most accurate way to measure is with the Goldman application tonometer.  Device measures the force required to flatten a fixed area of the cornea.  Normal pressure ranges from 10 to 22 mm Hg.  Important to note that some people have “normal“ pressure.  So its important to be aware of false negatives, and false positives.  
- The pressure measurements on the Goldman were calibrated using an average corneal thickness of 540nm, but some people have thinner or thicker corneas.  This is why ophthalmologists always check corneal thickness with an ultrasonic tachymeter on the first visit 
- *Optic disk*: With glaucoma the ganglion nerve layer slowly dies away, and, as fewer ganglion nerves course through the optic disk, the amount of cupping increases.  A cup to disk ratio greater than .5 or an asymmetry between the eyes suggests ganglion atrophy
- Acute glaucoma is a medical emergency
- This occurs when the lens plasters up against the back of the iris, blocking aqueous flow from the pupil.  This resistance produces a pressure gradient.  Without an exit pathway, aqueous fluid builds up, eye pressure increases rapidly, and the retina is damaged from stretching and decreased blood supply 
- *Vision Loss*: The vision loss from chronic glaucoma occurs in characteristic patterns that can be followed by automated perimetry.  Late stage patients may have 20/20 central vision, but be otherwise legally blind because of peripheral blindness
