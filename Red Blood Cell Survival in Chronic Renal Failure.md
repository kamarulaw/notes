## Red Blood Cell Survival in Chronic Renal Failure

##### **J. Ly, R. Marticorena, S. Donnelly (2004)**

### Methods
- This is an observational study assessing RBS survival in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis.  Patients were stratified into 3 groups according to their dialysis schedules: conventional thrice weekly, short daily, and nocturnal dialysis
- Patients were recruited if they were at least 18 years of age and had been on hemodialysis for at least 3 months
- Within the week of the study, patients underwent analysis of the following: complete blood count, reticulocyte count, electrolytes, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, iron, iron saturation, ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, parathyroid hormone, Coombs test, peripheral blood film, and prezialysis serum creatinine and urea
- RBC survival was estimated by an isotope tracer dilution method modified from Gray and Sterling as per UHN protocol
- Descriptive data were reported as means +/- SD.  Kruskal-Wallis test of nonparametric statistics was adopted for data analysis

### Results
- Twenty-two subjects participated in the study.  Twenty-one subjects underwent dialysis using iolysulfone membranes and 1 underwent dialysis using a diacetate membrane
- More than 70% of the patients were anemic, including 7 of 10 (70%) on conventional hemodialysis, 4 of 5 (80%) on nocturnal dialysis, and 4 of 7 (60%) on daily dialysis
- Only 4 patients had severe anemia with hemoglobin value below 11 g/dL.  The majority of patients required erythropoietin supplementation except for 2 in the conventional dialysis group and 2 in the nocturnal dialysis group
- All subjects were receiving folic acid, vitamin B12, and iron supplements and had either normal or high RBC folate and serum vitamin B12 levels
- In this study, the RBC half-life for normal subjects was 23.5 days, comparable with that reported in the existing literature, which supports the validity of this study methodology.  The RBC half-lives in the conventional, nocturnal, and daily hemodialysis groups were all lower
- No statistically significant difference in RBC survival was observed between the conventional thrice-weekly dialysis and those reported in the literature.  The RBC survival was significantly longer in the control group
- The lack of correlation between prezialysis urea level and RBC lifespan observed in this study was also documented in several other studies
- The utilization of serum urea concentration in the estimation of dialysis dosages is problematic because urea concentration can also be affected by other factors including total body volume and nutritional status
