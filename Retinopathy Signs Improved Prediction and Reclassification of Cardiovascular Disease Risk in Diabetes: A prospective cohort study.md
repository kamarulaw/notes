Summary: Cardiovascular risk prediction is imperfect, as risk models are derived mainly from the general population.  The paper examines whether the addition of retinopathy and retinal vascular caliber improve CVD prediction beyond established risk factors in persons with diabetes. 

### Dataset 
- Participants from the Singapore Malay Eye Study (SiMES, 2004 - 2006) and Singapore Prospective Study Program (SP2, 2004 - 2007).  These were people diagnosed with diabetes, but with no known history of CVD at the time of the study
- Participants in SiMES cohort were older, had more women, and hypertensive subjects compared with SP2
- Participants in SiMES had higher BMI, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL, creative level, BhA1c level, and lower eGFR

### Definitions 
- **C-Statistic**: Measure of goodness-of-fit for binary outcomes in a logistic regression model.  Gives the probability a randomly selected patient who experienced an event had a higher risk score than a patient who had not experienced the event.  Equals the area under the ROC curve
- **Biomarker**: A measurable indicator of the severity or presence of some disease state
- **CRP**: Protein that the liver makes when there is inflammation in the body.  Known as a marker of inflammation
- ** hsCRP**: high sensitivity CRP test…measures CRP
- ** eGFR**: Used to screen for and detect early kidney damage.  To help diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to monitor kidney status
- **Hosmer-Lemeshow**: A statistical test for goodness of fit for logistic regression models.  The test assesses whether or not the observed event rates match expected event rates in subgroups of the model population

### Notes
- Existing CVD models prediction models in persons with diabetes lack accuracy
- Retinopathy is a common, specific microvascular sign in persons with diabetes and is usually detected from retinal photographs during routine screening
- The presence of retinopathy in persons with diabetes is known to be associated with increased CVD risk
- Study evaluated the impact of adding retinal signs to traditional CVD risk factors, and a CVD risk prediction algorithm that included retinopathy and retinal vascular caliber assessed from retinal photographs
- The paper also explored the value of additional serum biomarkers in CVD prediction.  The paper finished by examining the robustness of the algorithm in an independent cohort with diabetes
- SiMES participants were older, with higher systolic blood pressure, and higher HbA1c level were more likely to develop incident CVD.  The predictive discrimination for incidence of CVD event of this model had a C-statistic of .721
- (M2) Serum biomarkers improved the C-statistic to .747.  (M3) When retinal measures were included the C-statistic went up to .751.  In both models, the difference compared to (M1) was not statistically significant.  
- (M4) Significantly improved risk discrimination, with a C-stat of .762.  (M5) similarly revealed that lower eGFR and higher hsCRP, lower CRAE and the presence of retinopathy are predictors of incident CVD w/ a C-stat of .774
- HL Chi Square p values: (M1) .91, (M2) .217, (M3) .633, (M4) .677, (M5) .402, indicating that none of the models had a significant lack 
- Paper demonstrated that a “multiple marker” approach might be better than traditional risk for CVD prediction in patients with diabetes
- The unique advantage of retinal parameters over other biomarkers in risk prediction is that the retinal vasculature directly reflects microvascular damage and are therefore discriminatory, whereas other factors are not as specific 
- Many patients with diabetes undergo retinal photography as part of annual checkups
- Limitations include a small increase in C-stats, indicating minimal change in overall discrimination
- After refitting in SP2, most of the predicting factors from SiMES were insignificant
- Further studies are required to generalize results to other populations
- The translation of of retinal photography as a tool to manage diabetes seems promising, but needs further work
