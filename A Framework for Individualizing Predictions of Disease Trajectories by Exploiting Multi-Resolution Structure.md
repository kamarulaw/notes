### 1 - Introduction
- In complex, chronic disease the way the disease manifests may vary greatly across individuals.  For example, in scleroderma individual s may be affected across six organ systems 
- If we could divide individuals into groups according to their mechanisms - or disease subtypes - it would be straightforward to fit separate models to each subpopulation.  In most complex diseases, however, the mechanisms are poorly understood and clear definitions of subtypes do not exist
- If subtype alone determined trajectory, then we could cluster individuals.  However, other unobserved individual-specific factors such as behavior and prior exposure affect health and can cause different trajectories across individuals of the same subtype
- The majority of predictive models in medicine explain variability in the target outcome by conditioning on observed risk factors alone.  However, these do not account for latent sources of variability such as those discussed above.  Further, these models are typically cross-sectional - they use features from data measured up until the current time to predict a clinical marker or outcome at a fixed point in the future
- Authors show that the factors contributing to disease trajectory can be in a hierarchy, but that not all levels of the hierarchy are observed
- Another common approach to dynamical predictions is to use Markov models such as order-p autoregressive models, HMMs, state space models, and dynamic Bayesian networks.  Although such models naturally make dynamic predictions using the full history by forward filtering, they typically assume discrete, regularly-spaced observation times 
- Gaussian processes are a commonly used alternative for handling continuous-time observations.  Since Gaussian processes are non-parametric generative models of functions, they naturally produce functional predictions dynamically by using the posterior predictive conditioned on the observed data.  Mixtures of GPs have been applied to model heterogeneity in the covariance structure across time series, however appropriate mean functions are critical for accurate forecasts
- Authors propose a hierarchical model of disease activity trajectories that directly addresses common - latent and observed - sources of heterogeneity in complex, chronic diseases using three levels: the population level, subpopulation level, and individual level 
  - The model discovers the subpopulation structure automatically and infers individual-level structure over time when making predictions
  - In addition, authors include a GP as a model of structured noise, which is designed to explain away temporary sources of variability that are unrelated to disease activity
- When making predictions for a given individual, the authors use Bayesian inference to dynamically update posterior belief over individual-specific parameters given clinical history and use the posterior predictive to produce a trajectory estimate.  Finally, Authors evaluate the approach by developing a prediction tool for lung disease in scleroderma
