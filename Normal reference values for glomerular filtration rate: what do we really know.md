what do we really know?

### Abstract 
- Article focuses on GFR and different ways to define its normal reference values
- The article focuses on GFR and different ways to define its normal reference values
- In this context, the authors compare two perspectives: first the reference values defined by measuring GFR in normal individuals (the ‘classical’ way) and secondly a fixed cut-off value at 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 according to the associated mortality risk (the ‘prognostic’ way)
- We know that GFR physiologically decreases with age, and in adults older than 70 years values below 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 could be considered normal
- There is an obvious discrepancy between the reference values defined either by the ‘classical way’ or by the ‘prognostic way’ which the authors think could be largely reduced, if age was better taken into consideration in these definitions

### Introduction
- Nowadays, the diagnosis of CKD is based on the measurement of two main biological variables: the presence of proteinuria and the decreased glomerular filtration rate for at least 3 months.  This article focuses on GFR and the difficulty of defining a ‘normal’ GFR value
- In this context, a main issue will be the physiological decrease in GFR with aging
- The choice of a fixed value as a cut-off between healthy and CKD status has been criticized.  Healthy elderly subjects could be considered as having CKD based on their age-related decline in GFR.  This decline in GFR with age is neither absolute nor predictable but is a phenomenon which encompasses senescence and may not necessarily be considered pathological 
- Goal of this article is to review data from the literature, thus allowing a more precise definition of the normal range of GF

### Preliminary Methodological Comments
- Estimating GFR with creatinine-based equations such as the MDRD or the CKD-EPI study equation can substantially underestimate GFR in a healthy population.  As a result the authors focus on mGFR whenever data are available
- Authors second methodological concern is the way ‘normality’ of a value can be determined.  The classical way is measuring GFR in a healthy population and calculating mean and SD (with stratification according to age) or calculating percentiles
- Another method to define reference values is based on the risk of morbidity or mortality due to a pathological state.  This is known as the ‘prognostic way’ 
- It is worth noting that classification into a ‘classical’ and ‘prognostic’ way means far more than just two similar approaches but in fact describe two wholly different entities with different statistical displays
- In the ‘classical’ case, the reference value might be useful for determining drug dosage or screening metabolic complications.  In the ‘prognostic’ case it can help to develop a treatment policy for people at a certain risk of developing that outcome.  So normal values in the first case might correspond to increased risk in the second case

### Distribution of GFR in healthy subjects: ‘the classical way’ 
- Authors state it is still not possible to predict normal GFR values for subjects older than 70 years with sufficient accuracy.  Several studies show some trends but the samples are very limited and/or little representative

### Normal GFR with a definition based on CKD-related mortality/morbidity risk: ‘the prognostic way’ 
- When we focus on studies analyzing the mortality risk of CKD according to mGFR levels, a thorough conclusion is not possible because such studies do not exist.  So data with eGFR must be used, which is, by itself, a limitation because of the poor precision of creatinine-based equations around the value of 60 mL/min/1.73m^2
- The impact of proteinuria on the cardiovascular and mortality risk bas been largely confirmed by data from the consortium trial.  The higher ‘power’ of the proteinuria parameter compared with the power of the eGFR in the mortality risk assessment is also evident
- Considering the general population, the overall mortality risk significantly increased when the cut-off for eGFR was set at 60 mL/min/1.73m^2

### Conclusion
- For subjects over 70 years, it is obvious that we do not know which mGFR values can be considered ‘normal’, even if we can assert that normal values are probably lower than in younger subjects and potentially lower than 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 for subjects above 70 years
- Thus, there is a gap between the classically measured normal GFR values and those proposed as normal by the K-DIGO following the ‘prognostic way’
