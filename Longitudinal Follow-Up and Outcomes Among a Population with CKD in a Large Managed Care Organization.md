### Abstract 
- CKD is the primary cause of ESRD in the United States.  The goal of this study is to understand the natural history of CKD with regard to progression to renal replacement therapy (transplant to dialysis) and death in a representative patient population
- The data showed the rate of renal replacement therapy over the 5-year observation period was 1.1%, 1.3%, and 19.9%, respectively, for the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiatives stages 2, 3, and 4, but that the mortality rate was 19.5%, 24.3%, and 45.7%.  Thus, death was far more common than dialysis at all stages
- In addition, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and anemia e=were more prevalent in the patients who died but hypertension prevalence was similar across all stages
- The data suggests that efforts to reduce mortality in the population should be focused on treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and anemia 
- Relatively little is known about 98% of patients with CKD who do not advance to ESRD 
- The objectives of the present work were to study the narwal history of CKD in a large health maintenance organization (HMO) population in the context of that framework, examining the prevalence of co-morbid conditions asscoiated with CKD and describing clinical outcomes (death, transplantation, and renal dialysis) over a 5.5 year period

### Methods

#### Research setting and study population
- Lab tests are performed by a single regional laboratory using standardized methods that are periodically recalibrated against reference samples.  eGFR was estimated using serum creatinine values captured in KPNWâ€™s lab information system
- Because data on race were not available, they were not included in the estimation of GFR.  The missing variable had the effect of underestimating GFR by 21.  However, less than 5% of the population is African American, so the overall population-level effect of this missing variable was minimal
