## Approach to Renal Replacement Therapy (90)

##### **H. C. Rayner, E. Imai, V. Kher**

### Definitions  
- **Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)**: A therapy that replaces the normal blood-filtering function of the kidneys.  It is used when the kidneys are not working well
- **Randomized Controlled Trial**: a type of scientific experiment which aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment
- **Hemodialysis**: the blood is circulated outside the body and cleaned inside a machine before returning to the patients
- **Peritoneal Dialysis**: a soft plastic tube (catheter) is placed in the belly by surgery, and a sterile cleaning fluid is put into your belly through this catheter.  After the filtering process is finished the fluid leaves the body through the catheter
- **Catheter**: thin tube made from medical grade materials serving a broad range of functions.  Medical devices that can be inserted in the body to read disease or perform a surgical procedure
- **Arteriovenous Filter**: Created by directly connecting a personâ€™s artery and vein.  As blood flows to the vein from the newly connected artery, the vein grows stronger.  Once the fistula has 

### Notes
- The number of patients starting renal replacement therapy each year varies enormously across countries

#### Prediction of End-Stage Renal Disease
- Preparation for ESRD treatment requires tow things: identification of patients who are at high risk for reaching ESRD and prediction of the likely time when RRT may be needed
- Diabetes, heavy proteinuria, declining eGFR, and previous episodes of acute kidney injury make it more likely that a patient will progress to ESRD

#### Multidisciplinary Care in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease
- Advanced CKD care aims to address several issues: preservation of remaining kidney function; prevention or treatment of complications of CKD; hemodialysis; other kidney management; etc. 
- Patients need time to understand and make decisions about dialysis and its implications.  The best approach is to transfer patients with a declining GFR to a multidisciplinary team at least 12 months before dialysis is started.  The start date can be predicted by extrapolating a trendline of the eGFR forward until it reaches 10 ml/min/1.73m^2
- Using the 12-month prediction rather than an arbitrary value of eGFR to prompt referral avoid elderly patients with slowly declining GFR from being referred for dialysis preparations
- For many, transplantation offers the best prospect for improved survival and quality of life, especially in younger patients.  Even in older patients with greater comorbidity, transplantation can improve survival and be cost effective

#### When Should Dialysis be Started?
- There is no single measure that can be used to determine the right time to start dialysis.  A low, eGFR, rising serum phosphate, and falling serum bicarbonate may indicate ESRD, but these levels are also affected by muscle mass and protein intake
- Falling serum albumin may indicate inflammation rather than malnutrition secondary to uremia
- Waiting for uremic symptoms to develop before starting RRT carries the risk that the patient will be malnourished when they start dialysis, with an increased risk for mortality

#### The Choice Between Peritoneal Dialysis and Hemodialysis
- Most patients with ESRD are suitable for treatment with either PD or HD
- Ideally we would choose between the two by applying evidence from a randomized clinical trail

#### Patient Choice of Hemodialysis or Peritoneal Dialysis
- The major differences in dialysis modality across countries suggests that the type of dialysis patients receive is more often determined by physicians and organizational factors rather than by patients

#### The Importance of Dialysis Access
- Before starting dialysis, every patient would ideally have made an informed choice between PD and HD after weeks or months of counseling and preparation, and those choosing HD would have a functioning AVF
- The timing of AVF placement is complex.  If an AVF is created many months before the patient is predicted to reach ESRD the chances that a catheter is used will be reduced
- If a fistula can be created swiftly and used as soon as it is mature, perhaps after only 2 weeks, the need for a catheter may be avoided

#### The Decision Whether to Offer Renal Replacement Theory
- Because of high cost, RRT is not available to most people with ESRD worldwide.
