## Risk factors for unplanned and crash dialysis starts: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis

### Definitions
- **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: the systemized collection of patient and population electronically-stored health information in a digital format.  These records can be shared in a Digital format
- **GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)**: is a measure of the function of the kidneys.  The test measures the level of creatine in the blood and uses the result in a formula to calculate a number that reflects how well the kidneys are functioning
 
### Background
- CKD defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m^2affects 8.1% of the American adult population (16.2 million people).  The estimated prevalence among Canadian adults is lower than 3.1%
- Studies show that the prevalence of CKD in the USA and Canada have increased over the past decade, likely due to a higher prevalence of risk factors for CKD,such as diabetes and hypertension, and an aging population
- An unplanned dialysis start is when a patient does not start dialysis using his or her chosen modality, starts dialysis during a hospitalization or, in certain studies, starts dialysis with a central venous catheter (CVC) as opposed to a permanent access AVF, AVG, or peritoneal dialysis catheter
- Unfortunately, there is non consensus definition on the exact timing of referral that qualifies a patient as “crashing” onto dialysis
