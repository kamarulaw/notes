Summary: Introduction to OCT Book

### Section 1: What is OCT
- Medical diagnostic imaging technology that captures micron resolution three-dimensional images.  It involves the measurement of light back-scattering through transparent or semi-transparent media such as biological tissue
- It achieves this by measuring the intensity and the echo time delay of light that is scattered from the tissues of interest
- There are two main ways in which the backscattered light can be detected: 1) Time domain (TD detection, 2) Fourier domain, which is further broken down into spectral domain and swept spruce
- **Time Domain OCT**: Light from the reference arm and light reflected back from the sample undergo interference, and the interference over time is used to generate an ‘A-scan’ depth resolved image of the retina at a single point
  - Moving the sample and the light source with respect to each other generates multiple A-scans that are combined into a cross-sectional image called the B-scan (line-scan)
  - Scanning speeds of TD-OCTs are typically around 400 A-scans/second
  - The primary commercially available TD-OCT device is the Stratus OCT by Carl Zeiss
- **Spectral Domain OCT**: The spectral interference pattern between the reference beam and the sample beam is dispersed by a spectrometer, and collected simultaneously with an array detector
  - The simultaneous collection allows for much faster scanning speeds than the traditional time domain devices where a mechanically moving interferometer gathers the data over time.  
  - Commercially available SD-OCT devices have scanning rates of 18k-70k A-scans/second
  - Both hardware and software enhancements permit precise image registration which allows for more reliable comparison between visits
  - The broader light sources of SD-OCT devices achieve a higher axial resolution than TD-OCT, allowing better visualization of retinal anatomy
  - Commercially available SD-OCT devices include: the Cirrus OCT by Zeiss, the Spectral OCT by Heidelberg, 3D-OCT 1000 (Topcon), Bioptigen SD OCT (Bioptogen), and the RT-Vue (Optovue)
- **Swept Source OCT**: The light source is rapidly swept in wavelength and the spectral interference pattern is detected on a single or small number receivers as a function of time
  - The spectral interference patterns obtained as a function of time then undergo a reverse Fourier transform to generate an A-scan image
  - The SSO has less sensitivity roll-off with depth, allowing better visualization of structures deep to the retina
- The most commonly used scans in evaluating retinal diseases are 1) macular cube scans and 2) line scans 
- **Macular Cube Scan**: Cube scans are ‘volume’ pr 3D scans analogous to computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans
  - SD-OCT machines acquire a rapid series of line scans, generally in a 6mm x 6mm square area centered on the fovea
  - In the Zeiss Cirrus SD-OCT, there are two macular cube scans available with no ability to customize.  Both scans a 6mm x 6mm area centered at the macula.  There is a faster 200 x 200 (200 B-scans each comprised of 200 A-scans) or the slightly slower 512 x 128 cube (128 B-scans each comprised of 512 A-scans) that has higher quality horizontal scans
  - **Raster scans**: Raster scanning is one method used to obtain cube scans of the macula.  This involves a systematic pattern of image capture over a rectangular area using closely spaced parallel lines.  It leads to a uniform sampling density over the entire area being scanned with the OCT
  - **Radial scans**: Consist of six to twelve high resolution line scans taken at radial orientations, all passing through the fovea.  A disadvantage of the radial line scan is the that the machine interpolates between the scans when generating macular thickness maps
  - **Mesh Scans**: Some machines include a mesh scanning pattern that acquire vertical and horizontal B-scans over the areas of interest
- Enhanced depth imaging (EDI) protocols, now available in all major commercial OCT use a combo of image averaging and of moving the zero delay line of the SD-OCT closer to the choroid, to obtain higher resolution images of the choroid. 
- Macular maps are derived directly from either the cube scan data or radical scans, depending on the machine.  They come in two forms: numeric displays showing the average retinal thickness in the zone of interest and color-coded displays illustrating the difference between the examination and age-matched normative data base

### Section 2: OCT Interpretation
- Can be both qualitative and quantitative
- **Qualitative Interpretation**: The clinician reviews individual line scans imaging the area of interest in the retina and makes qualitative assessment of the presence or absence of pathology based on a knowledge of normal anatomy.  When performing quantitative interpretation, it is important to be aware of the following issues
  - Registration: future line scans must be registered to past scans.  In other words, the examiner must be certain that the precise anatomic area of interest is scanned similarly in future tests.  All SD-OCT scans have this capability
  - Sampling error: If only one or several line scans are examined, the true pathology may be missed.  When doing qual interp it is important that multiple line scans through the macula are examined
  - Subjective evaluation: The lack of accurate quantitative numbers mean that line scan interpretation will be individualized.  In addition, it is hard to gauge the effects of pathology that is improving in one area of the macula but getting worse in another
  - Zones of line scans can be qualitatively described as hyper-reflective or hypo reflective, and demonstrate shadowing or reverse shadowing 
  - **Shadowing** occurs when there is increased absorption of light compared to the surrounding tissue.  This causes optical shadowing and decreased visualization of the outer tissues.  Vitreous debris, larger retinal vessels, hard exudates and highly pigmented areas cause shadowing
  - **Reverse shadowing** occurs when there is loss/atrophy of pigmented tissue that allows excessive light to be transmitted through to the outer layers.  Occurs when there is loss/atrophy of pigmented tissue that allows excessive light to be transmitted through to the outer layers
- **Quantitative Interpretation**: Relies on the ability of the OCT software to distinguish the inner and outer margins of the retina or sub-layers (e.g nerve fiber layer), referred to as segmentation, and accurately calculate retinal thickness and/or volume
  - Retinal thickness can then be compared to age-matched controls for assessment of normalcy, and monitored over time to judge the profession or regression of disease
  - Newer generation OCT software features the ability to register subsequent OCT scans so that measurements of retinal thickness are compared over the same area of the macula every time
  - When comparing quantitative OCT scans, it is important to compare scans obtained on the same machine, since different OCT machines draw the outer retinal boundary at different levels
  - The major drawback to quantitative assessment is that even in modern SD-OCT machines, quantitative scans are prone to artifacts

### Section 3: Artifacts on OCT
- Artifacts can occur during image acquisition or analysis due to software, patient, or operator factors.  Artifacts may affect the quantitative or quantitative interpretation of images and are therefore important to identify
- Common artifacts include: mirror artifacts, vignetting, misalignment, software breakdown, blink artifact, motion artifact, and out of range error
- **Software breakdown**: Result from misidentification of the inner or outer retinal boundaries causing incorrectly drawn OCT segmentation lines, resulting in inaccurate mapping and quantitative measurements of a volumetric scan
  - Outer line breakdown happens in conditions involving the outer retina/retinal pigment epithelium such as central serous chorioretionpathy, age-related macular dystrophy, cystoid macular edema and retinal atrophy

### Section 4: Normal Retinal Anatomy and Basic Pathologic Appearances
- Discrete hypo reflective spaces are noticed primarily in the outer retina, but usually span multiple layers
- **Subretinal fluid**: Clear hypo reflective space between the neurosensory retina and the RPE (CSRC, etc. )
- Retinal Pigment epithelial detachment: Dome shaped separation of the RPE from the underlying Bruch’s membrane.  The ensuing space between the RPE and the Bruch’s membrane is hypo reflective.  (DD: AMD, CSCR, etc.)

### Section 5: Interpretation of Optic Nerve OCTs
- The commercial available SD-OCT machines have two basic scan patterns used to evaluate the optic nerve: 1) volume scans, 2) line scans
- **Volume scans**: These are analogous to macular cube scans in which a volumetric set of data is acquired, centered at the optic nerve head.  
  - Software processing within the SD-OCT machine then identifies the center of the optic disc and creates a 3.46 mm circle centered on this location
  - The Heidelberg Spectralis volumetric scanning protocols acquire a set of three sequential circular scans, each with 256 axial scan, centered at the optic nerve head
- **Line scans**: A single or a series of high-rest B-scans can be obtained through the optic nerve head similar to the line scans obtained in the macula
- The information obtained from the optic nerve volumetric scans is processed to obtain the following details: Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) Thickness, Optic nerve morphology, Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC)
- **RNFL Thickness**: Calculated by the OCT devices as the distance between the internal limiting membrane and the outer aspect of the NFL
- **Optic Nerve Morphology**: The software in various SD-OCT machines also calculates and displays areas for the optic disc, cup, and rim, volumes for optic nerve head, cup and rim, cup-to-disc ratios and cup-to-disc horizontal and vertical ratios
- **Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC)**: Consists of three inner retinal layers: the NFL (formed by axons of the ganglion cells), the ganglion cell layer (cell body of the ganglion cells), and the inner plexiform layer (dendrites of the ganglion cells).  
  - The GCC scan is a series of B-scans centered on the macula and quantifies the thickness in all of these three layers.  
  - GCC thickness is calculated as the distance between the internal limiting membrane and the outer boundary of the inner plexiform layer
  - The GCC scan must be precisely centered at the fovea to have its results compared with a normative database, or to permit progression analysis
  - The GCC thickness may be displayed as an average overall thickness, averages in the superior and inferior hemiretina, superior-inferior difference in GCC thickness, the global loss volume, and the focal loss volume
- The glaucomatous composite figure showing the right and left optic disk and OCT printout show an increase in the C-T-D ratio with loss of neuroretinal rim tissue on the inferior aspect of the optic disk.  The optic nerve head map shows substantial retinal nerve fiber layer thinning in the inferotemporal sector in both eyes, with a corresponding thinning of the GCC in the inferior macula

### Section 6.1: Glaucoma
- Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells with resulting progressive visual field loss.  
- Retinal ganglion cell bodies are located in the ganglion cell layer of the inner retina.  Their axons constitute the RNFL
- The hallmark of glaucomatous optic neuropathy is a progressive loss of RNFL tissue eventually culminating in visual field loss, with associated changes
- Glaucomatous damage to the ganglion cells of the macula and the resultant overall macular retinal thinning can be assessed with GCC mapping
- OCT permits quantitative documentation and analysis of the areas most affected by glaucoma: the ONH, the peripapillary retina, and the macular retina
- The key anatomical features assessed on the ONH scan are: RNFL thickness, optic disc rim, and optic disc cup

### Section 7: Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration
- Accounts for a significant degree of visual disability in elderly populations
- Loss of vision is secondary to photoreceptor cell death, which manifests clinically as geographic atrophy (GA)
- Dry form does not currently have an effective treatment and accounts for 85% of cases
- The hallmark feature of dry AMD is the presence of drusen, which are yellow-colored sub retinal deposits that range in size and appearance

### Section 8: Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration
- The distinguishing feature is the presence of choroidal neovascularization in the setting of a patient over the age of 60 years, virtually always with some manifestations of concurrent or pre-existing dry AMD (drusen, geographic atrophy, RPE abnormalities)
- The most characteristic findings on OCT in wet AMD are the presence of an irregularly shaped PED with adjacent sub retinal hemorrhage and sub retinal fluid
- **Classic CNV**: present when the abnormal neovascular tissue penetrates the RPE/Burhc’s membrane complex and is present in the sub retinal space
- **Occult CNV**: present when the abnormal neovascular tissue remains underneath the RPE

### Section 9.2: Myopic Choroidal Neovascular Membrane
- Choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) can occur in the setting of the pathologic myopia, typically in pre-existing areas of Bruch’s membrane weakness such as lacquer cracks and chorio-retinal atrophy
- The CNV complex appears as a well-circumscribed area of mixed reflectivity in the sub retinal space with overlying sub- and intra-retinal fluid
- Sometimes, the presence of active CNV in high myopia can be difficult to discern, even with OCT.  In this setting, activity may be recognized by subtle changes on serial exams
- For such comparisons to be accurate, the scans that are taken at different times should be restored to assure the exact same region is being imaged over time
- In the case of CNV, thickness maps are often fraught with segmentation artifact and cannot always be relied on to make treatment decisions

### Section 13.1: Non-proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
- OCT scanning is not needed for the diagnosis of any form of DR, but DR is well characterized by OCT images
- Micro-aneurysms appear as hyper-reflective foci, mostly within the outer half of the retina, usually spanning more than one retinal layer
- Cotton wool spots appear as areas of moderate hyper-reflectivity within the nerve fiber layer
- DME is the primary cause of visual loss in NPDR  

### Section 13.2: Diabetic Macular Edema
- Effects one-third of people with diabetes
- The OCT appearance of DME can be categorized into four major types
  1) Thickening of the fovea with **homogenous optical reflectivity** throughout the whole layer of the retina
  2) Thickening of the fovea with markedly **decreased optical reflectivity** in mostly the outer retinal layers (cystoid changes)
  3) Thickening of the fovea with subfoveal fluid accumulation and stint outer border of detached retina
  4) Thickening of the fovea with **epiretinal membrane** formation with or without apparent **vitreofoveal traction**
- The qualitative assessment of OCT scans in DME are proving increasingly important in predicting outcome as well as determine which patients will respond best to individualized treatment
- Moreover, OCT may also show foveal microstructure changes such as the disruption of the IS-OS/ellipsoid layer and of the external limiting membrane, which may be correlated to visual acuity in DME.  Presence of hyper-reflective foci may also be associated with severity of the edema in DME and may reduce significantly with successful treatment of edema
