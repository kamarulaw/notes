## Chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease in the Medicare population 

##### **J. Futoma, M. Sendak, C. B. Cameron, K. Heller**

### Definitions
- **Medicare**: national health insurance program in the US that provides health insurance to Americans aged 65 and older.  It also provides health insurance to younger people with some type of disability status as determined by the Social Security Administration, as well as people with ESRD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 

### Abstract 
- The extent of diabetes, CKD, and CVD in the medicare population is relatively unknown.  Also unknown is the effect of these diseases on patient survival before end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
- Prevalent cohorts of Medicare enrollees from 1996 to 2000 were assessed for diabetes and CKD, presence of CVD, and probability of death versus ESRD in the follow-up period.  Hospitalization rates and, in diabetics, lipid testing and glycemic control monitoring were also assessed
- The prevalence of diabetes in the Medicare population increased at 4.4% per year, reaching 18.9% in the 1999-2000 cohort
- Approximately 726,000 elderly Medicare enrollees carry a diagnosis code for CKD.  Those with CKD are 5 to 10 times more likely to die before reaching ESRD than the non-CKD group
- In CKD patients, CVD is twice as common and advances at twice the rate.  Cardiovascular disease advances at a similarly higher rate in CKD patients who die and those who survive to ESRD
- Diabetes, the leading cause of ESRD, is increasing in the general Medicare population.  Cardiovascular disease is common, progress at twice the rate, is associated with death before ESRD, and patients receive suboptimal risk factor monitoring.  Active identification and treatment of CKD patients is needed

### Background
- Because CVD occurs at a higher rate in patients with elevated serum creatinine levels, it has been suggested that earlier identification and treatment of CVD in patients with CKD may reduce the severity of disease, thereby improving the outcomes of those who read ESRD treatment
- The National Kidney Foundation estimated that approximately 8 million individuals have an estimated individuals have an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m^2, and that 5.9 million of these individuals appear to be in the Medicare system within the group of enrolled aged 65 years and older.  Given that only 100,000 patients start dialysis each year, it is unclear what happens to most of the 8 million individuals with mild to advanced CKD
- The authors studied the Medicare population to determine the extent of clinically recognized CKD, the prevalence of associated CVD, and advancement toward ESRD or death

### Methods 
- Patients with CKD were identified from ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes in a manner similar to the method used by other investigators to identify patients with diabetes and other chronic diseases.  Coded conditions for which data were gathered included CKD from diabetes, hypertension, obstructive uropathy, and other diagnosis codes, as reported to the USRDS on the ESRD registration form
