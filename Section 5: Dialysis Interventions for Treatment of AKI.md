## Section 5: Dialysis Interventions for Treatment of AKI

##### **KDIGO**

### Definitions

### Chapter 5.1: Timing of renal replacement therapy in AKI
- Clinicians tend to delay RRT when they suspect that patients may recover on their own, and because of concern for the well-known risks associated with the RRT procedure including hypotension, arrhythmia, membrane bio-incompatibility, and complications of vascular access and anti-coagulant administration
- There is also some concern that RRT may compromise recovery of renal function, and increase the progression of CKD 

#### Rationale
- While no RCTs exist for dialysis for life-threatening indications, it is widely accepted that patients with severe hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary edema, and uremic complications should be dialyzed emergently
- In the absence of kidney function, and when therapeutic measures that promote the intracellular shift of potassium are exhausted, an excess of potassium can only be eliminated with RRT 
- On the other hand, when intermittent dialysis is used after these therapeutic interventions, the extracorporeal removal of potassium will be reduced and the post-treatment rebound of serum potassium will be more pronounced 
- Metabolic acidosis is a frequent clinical problem in patients with severe AKI.  Although the discussion as to when MA in critically ill patients should be corrected it is known that very rarely should urgent dialysis be required
- Traditional indications for RRT, developed for patients with advanced CKD, are not necessarily valid in the context of AKI
