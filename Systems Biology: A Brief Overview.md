## Systems Biology: A Brief Overview

##### **H. Kitano (2002)**

Abstract: To understand biology at the system level, we must examine the structure and dynamics of cellular and organismal function, rather than the characteristics of isolated parts of a cell or organism.  Properties of systems, such as robustness, merge as central issues, and understanding these properties may have an impact on the future of medicine.  

### Definitions
- Chemotaxis: The movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus

### Notes 
- The major reasons system-level understanding has gained interest today is that progress in molecular biology, particularly in genome sequencing and high-throughput measurements, enables us to collect comprehensive datasets on system performance and gain information on the underlying molecules
- A system-level understanding of a biological system can be derived from insight into four key properties: 
  1. System structures: these include the network of gene interactions and biochemical pathways, as well as the mechanisms by which such interactions modulate the physical properties of intracellular and multicellular structures
  2. System dynamics: how a system behaves over time under various conditions can be understood through metabolic analysis, sensitivity analysis, dynamic analysis methods such as phase portrait and bifurcation analysis, and by identifying essential mechanisms underlying specific behaviors.  Bifurcation analysis traces time-varying changes in the state of the system in a multidimensional space where each dimension represents a particular concentration of the biochemical factor involved
  3. The control method: mechanisms that systematically control the state of the cell can be modulated to minimize malfunctions and provide potential therapeutic targets for treatment of disease
  4. The design method: Strategies to modify and construct biological systems having desired properties can be devised based on definite design principles and simulations, instead of blind trial-and-error
- Progress in any of the above areas requires breakthroughs in our understanding of CS, genomics and measurement technologies, and integration of such discoveries with existing knowledge
- A steady-state analysis can be done using only the network structure, without knowing the rate constants for a particular reaction.  This highlights how the choice of analytical method used is strongly dependent on the availability of biological knowledge to incorporate into the model
- Understanding the mechanisms and principles underlying biological robustness is necessary for an in-depth understanding of biology at the system level.  The phenomenological properties exhibited by robust systems can be classified into three areas: (i) adaptation, which denotes the ability to cope with environmental change; (ii) parameter insensitivity, which indicates a systems’s relative insensitivity to specific kinetic parameters; and (iii) graceful degradation, which reflects the characteristic slow of a system’s functions after damage, rather than catastrophic failure
- In engineering systems, robustness is attained by using (i) a form of system control such as negative-feedback and feed-forward control; (ii) redundancy, whereby multiple components with equivalent functions are introduced for backup; (iii) structural stability, where intrinsic mechanisms are built to promote stability; and (iv) modularity, where subsystems are physically or functionally insulated so that failure in one module does not spread to other parts and lead to system-wide catastrophe
- Bacterial chemotaxis is an example of negative feedback that statins all three aspects of robustness 
- Comprehensiveness in measurements requires consideration of three aspects: (i) factor comprehensiveness, which reflects the number of mRNA transcripts and proteins that can be measured at once; (ii) time-line comprehensiveness, which represents the time frame within which measurements are made; and (iii) item comprehensiveness, which refers to the simultaneous measurement of multiple items, such as mRNA and protein concentrations, phosphorylation, localization, and so forth
