## Vascular Access for Dialytic Therapies (91)

##### **J. H. M. Tordoir**

### Definitions  
- **Arteriovenous Fistula**: abnormal connection between an artery and a vein.  Normally, blood flows from your arteries to your capillaries to your veins 
- **Central Venous Catheter**: a catheter placed into a large vein.  Catheters can be placed in veins in the neck, chest, groin, or through veins in the arms

### Notes
- Functional vascular access is needed for all extracorporeal dialytic therapies and remains the lifeline for patients treated with chronic hemodialysis (HD)
- The ideal HD access should have a suitable superficial vein that allows for cannulation in two places more than 5 cm apart and delivers blood for effective dialysis, usually of the range 400 to 1500 ml/min
- Ideally, a first access should be an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) placed peripherally at the wrist.  However, upper arm and lower limb access sites are increasingly used because the contemporary dialysis patients often have poor and diseased arm vessels that may be unsuitable for the creation of a simple wrist fistula
- Vascular access should be created with minimal delay by a surgeon experienced in vascular access creatine and ideally in time to avoid the use of a central venous catheter (CVC)
- A multidisciplinary approach to access creation and maintenance (involving nephrologists, interventional radiologists, access surgeons, and dialysis nurses) appears helpful for optimizing HD access-related outcomes and minimizing costs

#### Evaluation of The Patient For Vascular Access
- The earlier a patient with CKD is seen by a vascular access surgeon, the better the chance for the patient to have a well-functioning access at the initiation of HD.  An early decision on the type, side, and site of the first vascular access will be based on the following
