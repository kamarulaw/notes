## Acquired Macular Disorders (Chapter 14)


Summary: Introduction to Macular Disorders

### Definitions
- **Melanosome**: An organelle found in animal cells and is the site for synthesis, storage and transport of melanin, the most common light-absorbing pigment.  They are synthesized in the skin in melanocyte cells, as well as the eye in choroidal melanocytes and RPE cell

### Introduction 

#### Anatomical Landmarks
- The macula is a round area at the posterior pole, lying inside the temporal vascular arcades
- Histologically, it shows more than one layer of ganglion cells, in contrast to the single ganglion cell layer of the peripheral retina
- The inter layers of the macula contain the yellow xanthophyll carotenoid pigments lutein and zexanthin in far higher concentration than the peripheral retina

#### Retinal pigment epithelium
- The RPE is composed of a single layer of cells that are hexagonal in cross-section.  The cells consist of an outer non-pigmented basal element containing the nucleus, and an inner pigmented apical section containing abundant melanosomes
- The cell base is in contact with Bruch membrane, at the cell apices multiples thread-like villous processes extend between the outer segments of the photoreceptors
- At the posterior pole, particularly at the fovea, RPE cells are taller and thinner, more regular in shape and contain more numerous and larger melanosomes than in the periphery 
- RPE cells and intervening tight junctional complexes constitute the outer blood-retinal barrier, preventing extracellular fluid leaking into the sub retinal space from the choriocapillaries
- Its integrity, and that of the Bruch membrane, is important for continued adhesion between the two, thought to be due to a combination of osmotic and hydrostatic forces, possibly with the aide of hemidesmosomal attachments 
- The dense REP pigment serves to absorb stray light

#### Bruch membrane
- The Bruch membrane separates the RPE from the chriocapillaries and on electron microscopy consists of five distinct elements
  1. The basal lamina of the RPE
  2. An inter collagenous layer
  3. A thicker band of elastic fibers
  4. An outer collagenous layer
  5. The basal lamina of the inner layer of the choriocapillaries
- The RPE utilizes the Bruch membrane as a route for the transport of metabolic waste products out of the retinal environment

### Clinical Evaluation of Macular Disease

#### Symptoms
- **Blurred vision** and difficulty with close work may be an early symptom.  Onset can be rapid in some conditions such as CNV
- A **positive scotoma**, in which patients complain of something obstructing central vision, is a symptom of more severe disease
- Metamorphopsia, Micropsia, Macropsia, Colour discrimination disturbance, and Difficulties related to dark adaption are other common symptoms

#### Visual Activity
